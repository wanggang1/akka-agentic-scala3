# Template of empty project

To understand the Akka concepts that are the basis for this example, see [Development Process](https://doc.akka.io/concepts/development-process.html) in the documentation.

This project contains the skeleton to create an Akka service. To understand more about these components, see [Developing services](https://doc.akka.io/sdk/index.html).

You are supposed to change `empty-service` and the package name `com.example` to your own names.

Use Maven to build your project:

```shell
mvn compile
```

To start your service locally, run:

```shell
mvn compile exec:java
```

This service uses a Google AI Gemini model, which needs an API key at runtime. The key is read
from the `GOOGLE_AI_GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable (see `application.conf`). Copy
`.env.example` to `.env` (git-ignored), set your key there, then load it into the environment
before running — the JVM does not read `.env` automatically:

```shell
set -a && source .env && set +a && mvn compile exec:java
```

Tests do not need a key; they use `TestModelProvider`.

You can use the [Akka Console](https://console.akka.io) to create a project and see the status of your service.

Build container image:

```shell
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Install the `akka` CLI as documented in [Install Akka CLI](https://doc.akka.io/reference/cli/index.html).

Deploy the service using the image tag from above `mvn install`:

```shell
akka service deploy empty-service empty-service:tag-name --push
```

Refer to [Deploy and manage services](https://doc.akka.io/operations/services/deploy-service.html) for more information.
