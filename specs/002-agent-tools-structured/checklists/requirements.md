# Specification Quality Checklist: Structured, context-aware greeting

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/akka.clarify` or `/akka.plan`
- Validation passed on first iteration: spec is technology-agnostic (the WHAT/WHY of a structured,
  time-aware greeting), all SCs are measurable and tool-neutral, and reasonable defaults are
  captured in Assumptions (default timezone = UTC, coarse time-of-day labels, free-form tone) so no
  open clarifications remain.
