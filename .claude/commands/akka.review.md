```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Review Modes

This review supports two modes:

- **Full review** (default): Reviews the entire project against Akka SDK best
  practices. Runs the complete checklist below. Use this when no specific
  feature is mentioned, or when the user explicitly asks for a project-wide
  review.
- **Feature review**: Reviews the implementation of a specific feature against
  its spec, plan, and constitution, in addition to the best practices
  checklist. Activated when the user names a feature, or when SDD artifacts
  (spec, plan, tasks) exist and the user doesn't explicitly ask for a general
  review.

## Outline

### Steps 1-4: SDD alignment (feature review mode only)

Skip these steps entirely in full review mode.

1. **Setup**: Call `akka_sdd_list_specs` to find the target feature. Load the
   spec, plan, tasks, and checklist.

2. **Load context**: Read the constitution using `akka_sdd_constitution`.
   Understand what patterns and rules must be followed.

3. **Review implementation against spec**:
   - Are all functional requirements implemented?
   - Are all acceptance criteria met?
   - Are there deviations from the spec? If so, are they justified?

4. **Review implementation against constitution**:
   - Apply project-specific principles and rules from the constitution
   - Check that architectural decisions align with documented rationale

### Step 5: Akka SDK best practices checklist (always runs)

Load the review checklist. First check if a project-level checklist exists at
`.akka/review-checklist.md` — if it does, use that (read the file directly).
If not, fall back to `akka_sdd_get_template` with template name
`review-checklist` to use the plugin default. Walk through every check. For
each check, report PASS, WARN (acceptable deviation with reason), or FAIL
(must fix). For WARN and FAIL items, cite the specific file(s) and line(s).

### Step 6: Runtime verification (optional, either mode)

If the service is running locally (via `/akka.build`), use backoffice tools
with `local=true` to verify that the implementation behaves correctly at
runtime — not just in code:
   - `akka_backoffice_list_components` with `local=true` to confirm all
     expected components are registered
   - `akka_backoffice_list_events` to verify entities emit the expected events
     after commands (compare against spec's event definitions)
   - `akka_backoffice_get_workflow` to verify workflow steps execute in the
     expected order with correct state transitions
   - `akka_backoffice_query_view` to confirm views produce correct query results
   - `akka_backoffice_list_agent_interactions` to review agent tool calls,
     guardrails, and response quality
   - If the service serves a web UI, use `akka_browser_navigate` and
     `akka_browser_screenshot` to capture UI state for visual review

### Step 7: Report

   - **Mode**: state whether this was a full review or a feature review
   - Overall assessment: approved / approved with issues / needs rework
   - Issues found, grouped by severity (CRITICAL first, then RECOMMENDED,
     then DESIGN)
   - Checklist pass rate per section
   - If feature review: spec alignment summary (requirements met vs gaps)
   - Recommendations

## How to Work

- Use file search, grep, and read tools to gather evidence — do NOT assume
  compliance without checking code
- Check a representative sample (3-5 files per category) for pattern-based
  checks
- For one-of-a-kind checks (e.g., "does `definition()` exist"), grep the
  whole codebase
- Be specific: reference file paths and line numbers for every finding
- Every issue must cite the rule it violates (e.g., "violates A3")
- CRITICAL findings are reported as FAIL; RECOMMENDED findings are reported
  as WARN; DESIGN findings are reported as OBSERVATION
- For DESIGN checks, read the domain model, entity state shapes, event types,
  workflow steps, and component interaction patterns holistically — these
  cannot be checked mechanically
- Acknowledge good patterns and practices, not just problems

## Report Format

### Section Scores

```
Section                            | Pass/Total | Severity
A. Serialization & State           | N/3        | CRITICAL
B. Endpoints & Security            | N/2        | CRITICAL
C. Workflows                       | N/3        | CRITICAL
D. Agents                          | N/1        | CRITICAL
E. Views                           | N/4        | CRITICAL
F. Error Handling                  | N/2        | CRITICAL
G. Payload & State Size            | N/4        | CRITICAL
H. Code Quality & Safety           | N/3        | CRITICAL
I. PII & Data Sanitization         | N/4        | CRITICAL
J. Serialization Conventions       | N/4        | RECOMMENDED
K. Architecture & Conventions      | N/8        | RECOMMENDED
L. Endpoint Conventions            | N/6        | RECOMMENDED
M. Workflow & Agent Conventions    | N/10       | RECOMMENDED
N. Consumer & Idempotency          | N/9        | RECOMMENDED
O. Testing Conventions             | N/7        | RECOMMENDED
P. Error Handling Conventions      | N/3        | RECOMMENDED
Q. Design Review                   | N/13       | DESIGN
TOTAL CRITICAL                     | N/26
TOTAL RECOMMENDED                  | N/46
TOTAL DESIGN                       | N/13
```

Note: Skip sections that don't apply (e.g., no gRPC endpoints, no workflows).
Only count applicable checks in the total.

### Findings

Report CRITICAL findings first, then RECOMMENDED, then DESIGN. For each:
```
[ID] FAIL/WARN/OBSERVATION — Description
  Severity: CRITICAL / RECOMMENDED / DESIGN
  File: path/to/file.java, Line: N
  Evidence: <code snippet or grep result>
  Fix/Suggestion: <specific remediation or design alternative>
```

DESIGN items are reported as OBSERVATION with reasoning about the trade-off,
not as simple pass/fail. Explain what the current design implies for
performance or maintainability and suggest alternatives if appropriate.

### All Findings

List ALL findings, not just a top N. Group by severity: all CRITICAL (FAIL)
first, then all RECOMMENDED (WARN), then all DESIGN (OBSERVATION). Within
each severity group, order by impact.

## Customizing the Review Checklist

The review checklist can be customized per project. To create a project-level
copy that you can modify:

1. Copy the default checklist: `cp` the plugin template to
   `.akka/review-checklist.md`
2. Edit `.akka/review-checklist.md` to add, remove, or modify checks as needed
3. Future reviews will automatically use your project-level checklist instead
   of the plugin default

If `.akka/review-checklist.md` does not exist, the plugin's built-in checklist
is used.
